A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML.

In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

In this lesson, you will learn three properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser:

position
display
z-index

Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.
Instructions
Let's look at what we'll be building throughout the lesson! Compare the version that only utilizes default positioning for all elements to the version in which we've specified positioning to improve the appearance and usability of the site. You can see the differences between the styling if you look at style.css (the initial styles) and style1.css (the complete styles). When you feel ready to begin learning these properties, click "Next!"
